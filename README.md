## Outline
This script is intended to create a staking vault for SOL. The concept is simple, you deposit SOL and withdraw when you want it. Although rudimentary, I intend this to be an initial foray into Solana development and an exercise in project structure as well as basic operations.

## Todo
- [ ] Frontend
